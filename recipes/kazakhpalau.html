    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This hearty Kazakh Palau (also known as "Plov") is a traditional rice dish rich in flavor and history, commonly served during celebrations or family gatherings. It features fragrant rice simmered with tender chunks of lamb or beef, sweet carrots, and aromatic onions, all cooked together in seasoned oil. The dish is typically garnished with slices of boiled quail eggs and horse sausage (kazy), adding layers of texture and traditional Kazakh character. Each spoonful offers a warm, savory bite that reflects the essence of Central Asian hospitality.
