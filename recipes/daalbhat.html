    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This image shows a traditional Nepali Dal Bhat, a wholesome and comforting meal that is a daily staple across Nepal. At the center is a serving of steamed rice (bhat), accompanied by dal, a mildly spiced lentil soup made with garlic, turmeric, and cumin. Surrounding it are various side dishes including tarkari (mixed vegetable curry), saag (leafy greens), achar (spicy pickle), crispy papad, and a small bowl of sweet curd with dry fruits. A fresh salad of shredded vegetables and lettuce adds crunch and color. This well-balanced platter offers a complete combination of carbohydrates, proteins, fiber, and flavorâ€”representing the heart of Nepali home-cooked cuisine.
